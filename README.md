# league-of-legends-raport-maker
Simple app to track user progress in League of Legends. 

# What is this app?
It's Riot API based app that allows users to track their progress in game. <br/>
You can add any user from europe by his summoner name and app will prepare weekly and monthly raports with most important game goals like: <br/>
win ratio, minions per minute, wards per game, vision score per game, number of games played and KDA.
